## Lesson 1

### Course Intro

The course will cover topics like blockchain theory, Solidity, the Ethereum Virtual Machine, layer 2 solutions, gas optimization, security, and more advanced concepts.

### Eth intro 

- Intro on TLV for each chains.

- Ethereum is moving towards a more modular architecture with chains specialized for execution, settlement/consensus, and data availability.

- Layer 2 rollups are helping scale Ethereum by executing transactions off-chain and bundling them into the main chain.

- The Ethereum merge changed the consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake, improving finality and reducing centralization risks compared to proof-of-work.

- Intro on bloom filter

- Account abstraction proposals aim to add more functionality like paying fees in other tokens, multi-sig transactions, and social recovery to Ethereum accounts.

- Upcoming concepts like sharding may further improve scalability by distributing data and load across multiple shards (include blob).
